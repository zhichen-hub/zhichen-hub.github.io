# About Me

I am a PhD specializing in **Psychological Measurement (Psychometrics)** and currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and psychological science, with a focus on AI-driven assessment, multimodal data integration, and advanced psychometric modeling. I am particularly interested in **how large language models and other AI techniques can enhance personality assessment, intelligent testing, and psychological measurement more broadly**.

On this site, you will find information about my ongoing projects, publications, and academic contributions. I am committed to developing theory-informed, data-driven AI assessment methods, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, and translating methodological advances into real-world psychological and educational applications.
